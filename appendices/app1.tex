For your information, last year Skyline Communications organized an event called DataMiner Inspire. Customers from all over the world descended to Izegem to catch a glimpse of what Skyline has to offer in the (nearby) future. Among the guests, all the major players in the media industry, including representatives of Al Jazeera, Discovery Channel, Sky and OneWeb. The latter company is currently launching more than a 1000 satellites for the construction of a global internet system.

The screen capture was taken from a demo dashboard used throughout the event to show the capabilities of the DataMiner Dashboards application. Mind you, these dashboard components were not ready for production and were built specifically for the event.
