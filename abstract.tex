\textbf{first draft version, part about skyline should be taken out.}

For a period of 4 months I had the opportunity to be part of Skyline communications' team. Skyline communications is the global leader in end-to-end multi-vendor network management and OSS solutions for the broadcast, satellite, cable, telcom and mobile industry. One of the applications that is under development is called DataMiner Dashboards. Just like a dashboard, the application allows you to see KPIs at a glance. Data can be visualized in many different ways, including a table.

If we think about data visualization we immediately think about fancy charts. Pie charts that can illustrate numerical proportions, radar charts that can display multivariate data, histograms that can represent the distribution of data... But also a table is a data visualization. Unfortunately, more often than not, a table is considered as an intermediary form, a transitional state between raw data and a finished visualization. A table is pure and simple but yet a very powerful way to visualize data.  


\textbf{Keywords}:  Comparative research, user experience, prototyping software, table visualization
